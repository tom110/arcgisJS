    <p>This tool finds features (and portions of features) that are within the boundaries of areas in the first input layer.  For example:
        <ul>
            <li>Given a layer of watershed boundaries and a layer of land-use boundaries by land-use type, calculate total acreage of land-use type for each watershed. 
            </li>
            <li>Given a layer of parcels in a county and a layer of city boundaries, summarize the average value of vacant parcels within each city boundary.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only those features in the input layer and the layer to be summarized that are visible within the current map extent will be analyzed.  If unchecked, all features in both the input layer and the  layer to be summarized will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.

        <div>
            <p>If time is enabled on the input point layer and it is of type instant, then you can  analyze using time slicing.  There are three parameters you can set when you use time:

                    <li>Time Interval
                    </li>

            </p>
            <p>Imagine you had data that represented a year in time, and you wanted to analyze using weekly slices. To do that you would set you  <b>Time Interval</b> to <b>1 week</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Imagine you had data that represented a year in time, and you wanted to analyze using the first week of month. To do that you would set you  <b>Time Interval</b> to <b>1 week</b>, your <b>Time Step</b> to <b>1 month</b>, and your <b>Reference Time</b> to <b>January 1, at 12:00 am</b>.

        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>You can calculate statistics about attributes of numeric fields of the input layer such as: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Count
                    </li>

                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>You can calculate statistics about attributes of string fields of the input layer, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count
                    </li>
                    <li>Any &mdash;This statistic is a random sample of a string value in the specified field.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                All statistics are calculated on non-null values. The resulting layer will contain a new attribute for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic.

    <div id="spatialReference">
        <div><h2>SpatialReference (wkid)</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>This is a temporary parameter for Pre-Release  to set the processing spatial reference. Many big data tools require that a projected coordinate system is used as the spatial reference for processing. By default, the tool will use the input coordinate system, but will fail if it's a geographic coordinate system. To set a projected coordinate system, enter the WKID. For example, Web Mercator would be entered as  <b>3857</b>.
