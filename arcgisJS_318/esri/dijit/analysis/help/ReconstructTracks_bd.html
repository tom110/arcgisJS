        <h2><img src="./images/GUID-80807DB7-0CA7-4FD8-9702-B4486285D4FC-web.png" alt="Reconstruct Tracks"></h2>
        <hr/>
    <p>This tool works with a layer of
point features or polygon features that are time enabled with time type instant. It first
determines which features belong to a track using an identifier. Using the time at each location, the tracks are ordered sequentially and transformed into a line or polygon representing the path of movement. Optionally, the input may be buffered by some field, which creates polygons at each location. These buffered points, or if the inputs are polygons, are then joined sequentially to create a track as a polygon, where the width is representative of the attribute of interest. Resulting tracks have a start and end time, which represent temporally the first and last feature in a given track. When the tracks are created statistics about the input features are calculated and assigned to the output track. The
most basic statistic is the count of the number of points within
the area, but you can get other statistics as well.

    </p>
    <p>For example, suppose you have GPS measurements of hurricanes every 10 minutes. Each GPS measurement records the hurricane name, location, time of recording, and the wind speed. You could create tracks of the hurricanes using the name of the hurricane as the track identification, and all hurricanes tracks would be generated. You can calculate statistics like the mean, max and minimum wind speed of each hurricane, as well as the count of measurements in each track.
    </p>
    <p>Using the same example, you could buffer your tracks by the wind speed. This would buffer each measurement by the wind speed field at that location, and join the buffered areas together, creating a polygon representative of the track path, as well as the changes in wind speed as the hurricanes progressed.

            <p>Method used to join tracks   and apply buffer (if applicable). The planar method may calculate the results more quickly, but will not wrap tracks around the  international dateline or account for the actual shape of the earth when buffering. The geodesic method will wrap tracks around the date line if required, and apply a geodesic buffer to account for the shape of the earth.

            <p>You can calculate statistics about attributes of numeric fields of the input layer such as:

            </p>
            <p>You can calculate statistics about attributes of string fields of the input layer, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count
                    </li>
                    <li>Any &mdash;This statistic is a random sample of a string value in the specified field.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                All statistics are calculated on non-null values. The resulting layer will contain a new attribute for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic.
