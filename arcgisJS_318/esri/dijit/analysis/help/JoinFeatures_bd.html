    <p>The Join  Features  task works with two
layers  of features .  Join  Features  joins attributes from one
feature to another based on spatial, temporal and attribute
relationships, or some combination of the  three. The tool determines all input features that meet the specified join conditions and joins the second input dataset to the first. You can optionally join all features to the matching features, or summarize the matching features.
    </p>
    <p>Feature join can be applied to points, lines, polygons and tables without a geometry. You can optionally add a temporal join, as long as both input data sets are time-enabled, either as time instants or time intervals.

            <p>In addition to choosing a layer from your map, you can select  <b>Browse Layers</b> found at the bottom of the drop-down list to browse your contents for a big data file share dataset or feature layer.

            <p>This determines how joins between the layer to be joined to, and the joining layer will be handled in the output if multiple joining features are found to have the same relationship with the layer being joined to. There are two join operations to choose from:
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Join one to one</b>&mdash;this option joins all the matching features to the join layer,
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Join one to many</b>&mdash;this option summarizes all the matching features for each feature being joined to.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>For example, suppose we wanted to find supermarkets within 5 kilometers of a farmers market.   In this case the layer being joined to has a single feature representing a farmers market, and the joining features represents the local grocery stores which has attributes such as total annual sales. Using the  <b>Join Features</b> tool we find that five grocery stores meet that criteria. If we specified a join operation of <b>Join one to one</b> we would end up five features in our result, each row representing the market to a supermarket. If we specified a <b>Join one to many</b> relationship, we would end up with one feature, representing the farmers market and the summarized information from the supermarkets, such as the count (5), and other statistics such as the sum of annual sales.
