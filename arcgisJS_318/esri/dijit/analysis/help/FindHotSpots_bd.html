        <hr/>
    <p>The Find Hot Spots tool will determine if there is any statistically significant clustering in the spatial pattern of your data. 
        <ul>
            <li>Are your points (crime incidents, trees, traffic accidents) really clustered?  How can you be sure?
            </li>
            <li>Have you truly discovered a statistically significant hot spot (for spending, infant mortality, consistently high test scores) or would your map tell a different story if you changed the way it was symbolized?
            </li>
        </ul>
        The Find Hot Spots tool will help you answer these questions with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>Even random spatial patterns exhibit some degree of clustering.  In addition, our eyes and brains naturally try to find patterns even when none exist.  Consequently, it can be difficult to know if the patterns in your data are the result of real spatial processes at work or just the result of random chance.  This is why researchers and analysts use statistical methods like Find Hot Spots (Getis-Ord Gi*) to quantify spatial patterns.  When you do find statistically significant clustering in your data, you have valuable information.  Knowing where and when clustering occurs can provide important clues about the processes promoting the patterns you're seeing.  Knowing that residential burglaries, for example, are consistently higher in particular neighborhoods is vital information if you need to design effective prevention strategies, allocate scarce police resources, initiate neighborhood watch programs, authorize in-depth criminal investigations, or identify potential suspects.

        <div>
            <p>If time is enabled on the input point layer and it is of type instant, then you can  analyze using time slicing.  There are three parameters you can set when you use time:
                <ul>
                    <li>Time Interval
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Reference Time
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>Imagine you had data that represented a year in time, and you wanted to analyze using weekly slices. To do that you would set you  <b>Time Interval</b> to <b>1 week</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Imagine you had data that represented a year in time, and you wanted to analyze using the first week of month. To do that you would set you  <b>Time Interval</b> to <b>1 week</b>, your <b>Time Step</b> to <b>1 month</b>, and your <b>Reference Time</b> to <b>January 1, at 12:00 am</b>.

            <p>This is a temporary parameter for Pre-Release  to set the processing spatial reference. Many big data tools require that a projected coordinate system is used as the spatial reference for processing.

For example, Web Mercator would be entered as  <b>3857</b>.
