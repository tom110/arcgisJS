        <h2>Create Viewshed</h2><p/>
        <h2><img src="./images/GUID-BB8B8CAF-330E-4C41-9D94-AF4728D0D0F3-web.png" alt="Create Viewshed"></h2>
        <hr/>
    <p>The Create Viewshed tool creates areas where an observer can see objects on the ground. The input observer points can represent either observers (such as people on the ground or lookouts in a fire tower) or observed objects (such as wind turbines, water towers, vehicles, or other people). The result areas are those areas where the observers can see the observed objects and vice versa: the observed objects can see the observers.
    </p>
    <p>Both the observers and the observed objects can have a height above ground, and these heights are used in determining visibility. For example, a viewshed computed for 400-foot wind turbines and six-foot people standing on the ground will typically be larger than a viewshed computed for 200-foot turbines and six-foot people.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the computation of the viewshed does not account for obstructions such as trees or buildings. You can think of the computation as occurring on bare ground devoid of anything but the observer and observed objects.
    </p>
    <p>The result layer contains area features representing visible areas. The  <i>Frequency</i> field records the number of observer points that can see each area. For example, if you have five input points, each representing a fire lookout tower, the <i>Frequency</i> field will have values between one and five; areas with a value of one can only be seen by one tower, and areas with a value of five can be seen by all towers. The result layer also contains the <i>DEMResolution</i> field, which records the resolution of the digital elevation model (DEM) used to create the viewsheds.
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only the observer points that are visible within the current map extent will be analyzed. If unchecked, all observer points in the input layer will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.

The method for creating viewsheds is optimized for accuracty in the results, at the expense of a longer processing time. This is the default method.

                <li>Speed &mdash; 
The method used to calculate the viewshed is optimized for speed, trading some accuracy in the result for higher performance.
